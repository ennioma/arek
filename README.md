AREK is a clean and easy to use wrapper over any kind of iOS permission.

* show a native popup used to avoid to burn the possibility to ask to iOS the *real* permission
* show a popup to invite the user to re-enable the permission if it has been denied
* manage through an easy configuration how many times to ask the user to re-enable the permission (Only once, every hour, once a day, weekly, always😷)

🚨 AREK is a **Swift 3** and **XCode 8** compatible project🚨

# How to use AREK
## Check permission status
```swift
    let permission = ArekPhoto()

    permission.status { (status) in
        switch status {
        case .Authorized:
            print("Yoah! ✅")
        case .Denied:
            print("! ⛔️ !" )
        case .NotDetermined:
            print("! 🤔 !" )
        }
    }
```
## Request permission
```swift
    let permission = ArekEvent()

    permission.manage { (status) in
        switch status {
        case .Authorized:
            symbol = "✅"
        case .Denied:
            symbol = "⛔️"
        case .NotDetermined:
            symbol = "🤔"
        }
    }        
```

# Permission Configuration
Each permission type included in AREK is configurable through the *ArekConfiguration* struct. Each permission has a default configuration, so if you
are happy with the basic configuration you don't have to take care about how it works behind the scenes.

An *ArekConfiguration* is made up by:

> **frequency**: ArekPermissionFrequency (.Always, .EveryHour, .OnceADay, .OnceAWeek, .JustOnce)
This frequency value is related to how often you want to the user to re-enable a permission if that one has been disallowed.

> Set by default to **.OnceADay**


----------

>**presentInitialPopup**: Bool
This is an initial popup used to ask **kindly** to the user to allow a permission. This is useful to avoid burning the possibility to show the system popup.

>Set by default to **true**

----------
>**presentReEnablePopup**: Bool
This is the popup used to **kindly** to the user to re-enable that permission. The *frequency* value is related to this popup.

>Set by defaul to **true**
