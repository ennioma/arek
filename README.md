AREK is a clean and easy to use wrapper over any kind of iOS permission.

* show a native popup used to avoid to burn the possibility to ask to iOS the *real* permission
* show a popup to invite the user to re-enable the permission if it has been denied

## Check permission status

    let permission = EMPhoto()

    permission.status { (status) in
        switch status {
        case .Authorized:
            print("Yoah! ✅")
        case .Denied:
            print("! ⛔️ !" )
        case .NotDetermined:
            print("! 🤔 !" )
        }
    } 
```
## Request permission
```swift
    let permission = EMEvent()

    permission.manage { (status) in
        switch status {
        case .Authorized:
            symbol = "✅"
        case .Denied:
            symbol = "⛔️"
        case .NotDetermined:

        }
    }
